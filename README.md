# webscraping-tutorial
Contains examples R code to 'scrape' data from the web, including the use of RSelenium

There is a plethora of material on using various R packages to scrape data from the web.  Depending on the task at hand, the required code could be quite minimal (and not require anything other than base R) or, could require a fair amount of teeth-wrangling.

This compilation of R code snippets should serve as a "tutorial" on how to navigate the task of figuring out which road to go down, whether it be navigated by common webscraping packages (XML, XML2R, rvest, etc), or more comprehensive packages like RSelenium.

Thanks in advance for the authors of the various blurbs, blogs, youtube videos, and tutorials on this very subject that enabled this composite to be compiled.
